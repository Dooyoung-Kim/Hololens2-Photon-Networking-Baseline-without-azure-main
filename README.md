# Hololens2-Photon-Lobby-Networking
 Networking with Lobby System
 
 Beginning from 'Launcher' Scene
 4 rooms are named as 'Room for 1', 'Room for 2', 'Room for 3', 'Room for 4'
 
 Object Networking with Cube prefab in each room scene work well

Issues
1. Leave Room didn't work well
2. Avatar/Object Augmentation with 'Network Lobby' Component should be changed.
